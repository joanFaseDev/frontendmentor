## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CUBE CSS

### What I learned

I did a ton of mistakes on that project which is good because now i can learn a lot! So, to resume, what i learned is:

- **Don't think pixel perfect**
  Having a figma file with all sizes, dimensions and spacing is great but i lost myself in numbers and ended up with a rigid design using way too much absolute values. It's better to be close to the design while conserving flexibility and responsiveness.

- **The importance of good naming convention**
  I thought i understood that concept, i really did but that project was way bigger than my previous ones and that added complexity makes me realize that my naming system is bad. I created way too many variables which ended up being used only once and the more i worked on that project the more i had trouble finding the values i was searching for.

- **Going mobile first is good but only if one remove as much complexity as possible**
  Mobile design has the advantage of having lesser available space comparing to tablet/desktop which means there's often no need to rely on complex layouts and lots of combinaison properties. By default, Html pages are responsive but i ended up breaking that responsiveness by adding way too much css stuff from the get-go. I could have made the mobile design way much simpler which could have helped me tremendously when doing tablet and desktop design.

### Continued development

I'm going to keep working on layout tools like flexbox and grid but also studying position and float properties. I really felt my lack of knowledge on this project but also my difficulty to set up elements where i want them and move them appropriately.

I'm also going to put extra effort into naming convention. Be it BEM, CUBE CSS or a mix up, i need to find a system i'm confortable with and which can carry me through a project from start to end.
